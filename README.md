# Work Scripts
Various shell scripts I made while at work to accomplish or ease simple tasks.
A lot of these are just me not wanting to type obscenely long find commands
over and over again.

## Unverified?
My work machine won't allow me to commit over SSH, so a token was used to push
to this repository. They're signed, but unverified because my work email was
used to make the commits. It's me. Promise.
